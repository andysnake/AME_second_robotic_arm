WorkFlow Pipeline:

-> Getting robots working - done
-> Picking and Placing on Table by robot 1:
        -> Place robot 1 in appropriate position
        -> Cart/ tray for the robot to pick up objects
        -> Collision objects to be defined for the robot 1
        -> Place operation on the Table

-> Vision system:
        -> Scanning of part
        -> Sending trajectories based on scan

->Pick and Place for Robot 2:
        -> Pick object from the table
        -> Bins/ tray to place objects
        -> Table to place for milling.

ROS architecture:

-> Process controller to control the WorkFlow of the Process and sending trajectories to the robots
-> Planning groups and trajectories for each robot
-> Collision object definition :::: Main issue


How to:

-> Everyday 1 hour till 30th to complete these things
-> Working till 10th to complete milling and integration
